# Pomelo ReactJS/NextJS Challenge

Welcome to the Pomelo ReactJS/NextJS challenge!

## Principles & Ground Rules

Please focus on those four principles while writing code: **clarity**, **simplicity**, **defensiveness** and  **resilience**.

- **Clarity**: write clear code that any developer can read and understand in one go.

- **Simplicity**: write gimmick-free and straightforward code with no ambiguities.

- **Defensiveness**: cover edge cases and treat user inputs with care.

- **Resilience**: gracefully handling an error and unexpected behaviour.


* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time, if you need it. A swift rejection usually matches a rushed job.
* Submission is made via a zip archive of your git-based project.
* Send your submission to [coding-challenge@pomelofashion.com](mailto:coding-challenge@pomelofashion.com?subject=nextjs-coding-challenge)

## Testing your implementation

Note that we require you to add full test coverage and that all tests pass before we can invite you in for an interview.

In test mode, no network connection is made to 3rd party servers.

## The assignment

#### Instructions

Implement a website built with NextJS that displays the information retrieved from the [​New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) in the best way possible in terms of performance, UX and UI.

**The following sections should be present:**
- Homepage:​ list the most popular articles (Most Viewed by Section & Time Period)
- Detail page:​ show the article
- Navigation:​ to go back from the details page to the homepage and vice versa

The Homepage:

- should include a search form that allows a user to search for articles
by a search term/text string.
- should automatically update the list given this search results without reloading the page

**Notes:**
- The application should start with a simple command
- Provide a README file containing instructions on how to compile/start
the application
- The application should be responsive, it should work fine on either Desktop or Mobile


### Guidelines

- Don't forget documentation (inline, swagger, etc.).
