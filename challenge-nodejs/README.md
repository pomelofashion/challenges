# Pomelo NodeJS Challenge

Welcome to the Pomelo NodeJS challenge!

## Principles & Ground Rules

Please focus on those four principles while writing code: **clarity**, **simplicity**, **defensiveness** and  **resilience**.

- **Clarity**: write clear code that any developer can read and understand in one go.

- **Simplicity**: write gimmick-free and straightforward code with no ambiguities.

- **Defensiveness**: cover edge cases and treat user inputs with care.

- **Resilience**: gracefully handling an error and unexpected behaviour.


* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time, if you need it. A swift rejection usually matches a rushed job.
* Submission is made via a zip archive of your git-based project. 
* Send your submission to [coding-challenge@pomelofashion.com](mailto:coding-challenge@pomelofashion.com?subject=nodejs-coding-challenge)

## Testing your implementation

Note that we require you to add full test coverage and that all tests pass before we can invite you in for an interview.

In test mode, no network connection is made to 3rd party servers.

## The assignment

### Part 1

#### Instructions

In the first part of this assignment, you'll need to create a [HapiJS application](https://hapi.dev/).

- The application needs to have an endpoint that takes a body containing a `JSON` document following the format presented below under [Appendix 1 Input](#appendinx-1-input) as one of the parameters.
- Upon receiving a call, the [HapiJS](https://hapi.dev/) application should run an algorithm to turn the input into the format shown under [Appendix 2 Output](#appendix-2-output). The `JSON` document needs to be re-organized by moving children into the correct parents.
- The application should then return the formatted document in a `JSON` document.

#### Algorithm Details

You'll need to write an algorithm in JavaScript in your [HapiJS](https://hapi.dev/) application to transform the `JSON` input below into the `JSON` output. Each child should be placed in the `children` array of its parent (as defined by the `parent_id`).

#### Appendix 1 Input

```json
{"0":
  [{"id": 10,
    "title": "House",
    "level": 0,
    "children": [],
    "parent_id": null}],
 "1":
  [{"id": 12,
    "title": "Red Roof",
    "level": 1,
    "children": [],
    "parent_id": 10},
   {"id": 18,
    "title": "Blue Roof",
    "level": 1,
    "children": [],
    "parent_id": 10},
   {"id": 13,
    "title": "Wall",
    "level": 1,
    "children": [],
    "parent_id": 10}],
 "2":
  [{"id": 17,
    "title": "Blue Window",
    "level": 2,
    "children": [],
    "parent_id": 12},
   {"id": 16,
    "title": "Door",
    "level": 2,
    "children": [],
    "parent_id": 13},
   {"id": 15,
    "title": "Red Window",
    "level": 2,
    "children": [],
    "parent_id": 12}]}
```

#### Appending 2 Output

```json
[{"id": 10,
  "title": "House",
  "level": 0,
  "children":
   [{"id": 12,
     "title": "Red Roof",
     "level": 1,
     "children":
      [{"id": 17,
        "title": "Blue Window",
        "level": 2,
        "children": [],
        "parent_id": 12},
       {"id": 15,
        "title": "Red Window",
        "level": 2,
        "children": [],
        "parent_id": 12}],
     "parent_id": 10},
    {"id": 18,
     "title": "Blue Roof",
     "level": 1,
     "children": [],
     "parent_id": 10},
    {"id": 13,
     "title": "Wall",
     "level": 1,
     "children":
      [{"id": 16,
        "title": "Door",
        "level": 2,
        "children": [],
        "parent_id": 13}],
     "parent_id": 10}],
  "parent_id": null}]
```

### Part 2

#### Instructions

Use the [GitHub Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/traversing-with-pagination/) with pagination to find all the repositories that match the query `nodejs`. Display results 10 by 10 in a view in the [HapiJS](https://hapi.dev/) application you built in Step 1. Results should be displayed in a table (it doesn't have to look good) and, the pagination should be fully functional on the front-end side.

### Guidelines

- Don't forget documentation (inline, swagger, etc.).
- The pagination between your local application and the GitHub results should be synced.
